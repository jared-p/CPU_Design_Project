# CPU Design Project

This project involved designing a 32-bit instruction CPU. The CPU follows ARM instruction decoding communicates using a 16-bit address bus (2^16 RAM size). CPU has been testbenched in ModelSim. final_design_testbench.v can be used to feed the CPU a new set of instructions from a text file.
